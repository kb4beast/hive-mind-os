## Mandatory execution-surface policy

Read `.autopilot/workflow-policy.json`. **ChatGPT Classic owns this node.** Do as much work as possible in Classic with available reasoning, GitHub/connectors, files, web, and deterministic tools. Do not use Codex because work is difficult or faster there. Exhaust Classic/tool paths and role-first consultation first.

If one remaining action truly needs a capability unavailable in Classic, emit only a **short token-aware CODEX SUBTASK** for that action (repo/node, exact base SHA if relevant, exact scope, task/commands, evidence to return, stop condition), then return the evidence to Classic and resume the node.

If genuine human action remains, never assume prior knowledge: give exact click-by-click UI steps or copy-paste commands, what should appear, what to send back, and safety/rollback guidance.

Every final response must contain `WHAT I DID`, `NEXT STEPS`, and `BLOCKS`; use `None.` for BLOCKS when clear.

Read `.autopilot/README.md`, the node contract, prior receipt/failure evidence, the open
PR, and failing CI logs. Repair only the accepted node scope. Do not restart the node
from memory, broaden authority, weaken tests, erase adverse evidence, or switch models
without recording the escalation reason. Re-run exact candidate verification and append
a new receipt. Stop at a green draft PR; do not merge.
